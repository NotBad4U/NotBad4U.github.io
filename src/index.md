I am a PhD student in the Veridis team at Inria Nancy, LORIA, under the supervision of [Stephan Merz](https://members.loria.fr/Stephan.Merz/) and [Gilles Dowek](https://lsv.ens-paris-saclay.fr/~dowek/). I am also an associate member of the Deducteam at the Laboratoire MÃ©thodes Formelles.

My primary research interests focus on type theory, logic, and automated reasoning. 
My current research involves proving the correctness of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers used in automated theorem proving.
I have independently studied category theory and topos theory as complementary areas of interest, with the goal of contributing to these fields in the future.

I am also a member of [Europroof working group 1](https://europroofnet.github.io/wg1/): _Tools on Proof Systems Interoperability_.

**Research interests:**
- Logical frameworks
- Dependent type theory
- Category theory
- Rewriting logic
- Automated Reasoning
